//always define relational operators(limit) in while condition and 
//define conditions in if statement
//becoz here during first time execution while is true and if also true so i is incremented
//then while is true but if is not true so i is not printed afterwards and during each while 
//loop execution hello is printed
// the hi print is never executed since while loop is never ending
